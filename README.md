# Food-App


Our Food App, built with React for a smooth and dynamic user experience, offers an efficient and enjoyable way to add food to your cart and place orders. Here’s how it works:

- **Browse Our Menu:** Explore our extensive menu with a React-powered interface that provides a seamless browsing experience. Filter dishes by cuisine, dietary preferences, or popularity to find exactly what you want.

- **Add to Cart:** Select your desired items and customize your order with options like quantities, add-ons, and special instructions. The React-based cart updates in real-time, ensuring you see the most current total cost as you make changes.

- **Review Your Cart:** Access your cart to review and modify your selections. React’s interactive components allow you to easily adjust quantities, remove items, or update your choices. The cart summary reflects any changes instantly.

- **Proceed to Checkout:** Tap “Checkout” to enter your delivery address or select pickup. React handles the form validation and user inputs dynamically for a smooth checkout process.

- **Place Your Order:** Confirm your order details and payment information, then tap “Place Order.” Our React-based app will provide an order confirmation along with an estimated delivery time or pickup instructions.


Enjoy a hassle-free dining experience with our Food App. From selecting your favorite dishes to placing an order, everything is designed to be quick and convenient. Happy eating!
